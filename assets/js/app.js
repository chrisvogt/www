console.error("Error: Requires Babel \"^7.0.0-0\", but was loaded with \"6.26.3\". If you are sure you have a compatible version of @babel/core, it is likely that something in your build process is loading the wrong version. Inspect the stack trace of this error to look for the first entry that doesn't mention \"@babel/core\" or \"babel-core\" to see what is calling Babel.
