  Playing "Here, There and Everywhere" on the piano. This is the first in a
  series where I'll share recordings of what I'm practicing on the piano when
  I find myself playing something I feel like sharing.

<span class="text-drop-cap">I</span> just got a digital piano, and for the first time in my adult life have easy access to a piano at home. This post is the first in a series where I'll share what I'm learning on the piano when I find myself playing something I like.

This first recording is a jazz rendition of "Here, There and Everywhere" found in *<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1495069087/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1495069087&linkCode=as2&tag=chrisvogt-20&linkId=d3bcf5df82deddf5da6d085094d35945">The Beatles - All Jazzed Up!</a>* recorded on a Nikon dSLR and an iPhone. Using YouTube, I figured out how to create and edit a multi-camara sequence in Premiere Pro. The resulting video is very amateur, but I'm happy with it for a first attempt.
